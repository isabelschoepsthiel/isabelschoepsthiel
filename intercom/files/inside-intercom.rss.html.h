In this episode, Maxime Manseau, VP of Support at Birdie, joins Intercom's Senior Director of Human Support Bobby Stapleton to explore the hidden costs of misdiagnosis in customer support: longer resolution times, frustrated customers, and burned-out agents. They discuss how improving issue understanding upfront ‚Äì through better workflows, AI-powered tools, and even screen recordings ‚Äì can dramatically reduce back-and-forth and create a smoother customer experience. Plus, they explore why human support still matters in an AI-first world, and how that directly impacts your customers.</p><p><br></p><p>Watch on YouTube: https://youtu.be/vxxH1Ulw7FA?si=oz1GqLaByFbq_TrK</p><p><br></p><p>Follow the people:</p><p>https://www.linkedin.com/in/maximemanseau/</p><p>https://www.linkedin.com/in/bobbystapleton/</p><p><br></p><p>Newsletters:</p><p>Sign up for The Ticket: A twice-monthly newsletter bursting with all the insights, trends, tips, and assets your team needs to embrace the future of customer service. https://www.intercom.com/blog/newsletter</p><p><br></p><p>Sign up for Intercom on Product: a monthly newsletter sharing our latest thinking on building and designing great products, and how that's changing in the age of AI.</p><p>https://inter.com/productpodcast</p><p><br></p><p>Follow The Ticket podcast:</p><p>Apple Podcasts https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-ticket-discover-the-future-of/id996103731</p><p>Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/6zlcXgcd2kX9E4cbQTCsR9</p><p>YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlCIldMZCaFrn43ZNAiw00icA-nRW5wVF</p><p>RSS Feed https://art19.com/shows/inside-intercom</p><p><br></p><p>Say hi:</p><p>LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/intercom/</p><p>X: https://x.com/intercom</p><p><br></p><p>Get a free trial of Fin, our breakthrough AI chatbot, here: https://www.intercom.com/fin</p><p><br></p><p>www.intercom.com</p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href="https://art19.com/privacy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href="https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>]]>
